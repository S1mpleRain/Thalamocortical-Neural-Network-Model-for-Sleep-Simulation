# Thalamocortical-Neural-Network-Model-for-Sleep-Simulation
implements a biologically-inspired thalamocortical neural network computational model to study neural activity patterns and EEG signal characteristics during different sleep stages. The model integrates multi-layered cortical structures with thalamic networks to reproduce neural oscillations features of various sleep states
